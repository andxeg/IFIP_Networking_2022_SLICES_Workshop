"General Notes"

"Used Environment Variables:"
"  ENV_KMP_AFFINITY=compact,0 - assign OpenMP Threads continously"
"  ENV_OMP_NUM_THREADS=128 - limits number of Threads to be started to 128"
"  ENV_KMP_HW_SUBSET=1S,64C,2T - control Thread distribution accross sockets, cores and hw threads"
"  ENV_FORT_BUFFERED=true - enables buffered I/O for Fortran"
"  ENV_OMP_DYNAMIC -     Enable or disable the dynamic adjustment of the number of threads within a team. If undefined, dynamic adjustment is disabled by default."
"  ENV_KMP_LIBRARY - Selects the OpenMP runtime library throughput. The options for the variable value are: serial, turnaround, or throughput indicating the execution mode."
"  ENV_KMP_BLOCKTIME - Sets the time, in milliseconds, that a thread should wait, after completing the execution of a parallel region, before sleeping."
